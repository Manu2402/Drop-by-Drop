# ErosionScape

**ErosionScape** is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5 focused on applying hydraulic erosion to landscapes. The tool allows you to realistically simulate water erosion using an advanced and customizable parametric system. You can start from an external heightmap or generate a new one directly within the plugin, and optionally split the landscape into proxies. Erosion parameters can be saved as templates and reused across different landscapes, streamlining the workflow and ensuring visual consistency.

## Main Features

- **Heightmap Support**  
  Import external heightmaps or generate one procedurally using Perlin noise and customizable parameters.

- **Proxy Splitting**  
  Automatically split the landscape into multiple proxies for better management and performance.

- **Water Erosion Simulation**  
  Apply realistic erosion based on adjustable parameters such as droplet count, erosion radius, sediment capacity, and more.

- **Template System**  
  Save and load erosion presets to reuse them across multiple landscapes and maintain workflow consistency.

## Templates

- Templates store all erosion parameters.
- They can be loaded and applied to any generated landscape.

## Development

This project was developed in collaboration by **Manuel Solano** and **Roberto Capparelli** as part of a research and development initiative focused on landscape generation tools for Unreal Engine.

## Demo Video

The following video provides a full demonstration of the tool: from generating or importing the heightmap, to splitting the landscape into proxies, and applying water erosion. The video also includes a step-by-step guide on how to use all the main features of the plugin.
